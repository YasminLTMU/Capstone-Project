# CIND820 Capstone Project Repository

This repository contains the CIND820 Capstone Project files which consists of the MIMIC III dataset, EDA html file, Python/Jupyter notebooks and an outline of the tenative stages of this project.

## Tenative Stages of Project

This aim of this project is ICU patient mortality prediction. There are several research questions that will need to be answered during this project. These are:

-Is it possible to create a highly accurate ICU admitted patient survival model?

-What are the most influential predictors of ICU patient survival?

-How do demographic factors, such as age and gender, impact ICU patient survival?

-Does the presence of chronic illnesses and comorbidities, impact ICU patient resilience and response to treatment?
